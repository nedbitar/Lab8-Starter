Graceful Degradation is a concept that a website should remain functional in the situation you are not connected to the internet. Not all websites are functional once you disconnect from them, some are, such as gmail and MonkeyType. Service workers are similar to applications. Once your visit a website, the service worker sets itself up. If you are disconnected from the network, the service worker steps in and provide functionality, but once you reconnect you fetch the latest version of the service worker. Sercice Workers allow you to create a web application that can work both offline or online.
